- Using different types of CSS such as Inline, Internal/Embedded, and External.
- Utilizing Class Mentor office hours for tips, tricks, and unblocking. 
- Exploring and practicing [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) to identify best practice and deprecated web development features.
- Conducting market research within the class materials as well as public pages to garner creative stylings for my page such as[Sophie Zanzinella](https://vigilant-lumiere-2756fa.netlify.app/) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)
- Learning to avoid [`<center>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/center) and instead use [`text-align:center;`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align).
- Avoid [`<marquee>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/marquee) and instead use [`css animation`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation)
- To better define the meaning of the content, use [semantic](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) tags such as [`<header>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header), [`<nav>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav), [`<section>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section), [`<article>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article), [`<aside>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside), and [`<footer>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer) and avoid using generic containers like [`<div>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div) and [`<span>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) 
- Learned how to use [`text-align`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) and [`justify-content`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content) to better format containers
- Not required, learned [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) Markdown

This has been an exciting adventure so far.
